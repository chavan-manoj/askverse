# Architectural Decisions

## 1. Multi-Agent Architecture

### Decision
Implement a multi-agent system with specialized agents for different tasks (document search, API integration, data processing).

### Rationale
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent can be optimized for its specific task
- **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on workload
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update or replace individual components
- **Parallel Processing**: Agents can work concurrently on different aspects of a query

### Alternatives Considered
- Single monolithic agent
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven architecture

## 2. Vector Database for Document Search

### Decision
Use a vector database (Pinecone) for storing and searching document embeddings.

### Rationale
- **Efficient Semantic Search**: Vector similarity search is more effective than keyword-based search
- **Scalability**: Vector DBs are optimized for high-dimensional data
- **Real-time Updates**: Supports dynamic document updates
- **Cost-effective**: Better performance/cost ratio compared to traditional search engines

### Alternatives Considered
- Elasticsearch
- Traditional SQL databases with full-text search
- In-memory vector storage

## 3. FastAPI for API Gateway

### Decision
Use FastAPI as the framework for the API gateway.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: High performance with async support
- **Type Safety**: Built-in type checking and validation
- **OpenAPI Generation**: Automatic API documentation
- **Modern Features**: Built-in support for async/await, WebSockets
- **Easy Testing**: Built-in test client and dependency injection

### Alternatives Considered
- Flask
- Django REST Framework
- Express.js

## 4. OAuth2/JWT Authentication

### Decision
Implement OAuth2 with JWT for API authentication.

### Rationale
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted authentication protocol
- **Stateless**: JWTs are stateless and scalable
- **Security**: Built-in security features and token expiration
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple authentication providers

### Alternatives Considered
- API Keys
- Session-based authentication
- Custom authentication scheme

## 5. LangChain Integration

### Decision
Use LangChain for LLM interactions and chain composition.

### Rationale
- **Abstraction**: Provides high-level abstractions for LLM operations
- **Chain Composition**: Easy to create complex workflows
- **Tool Integration**: Built-in support for various tools and integrations
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and community support

### Alternatives Considered
- Direct OpenAI API calls
- Custom LLM wrapper
- Other LLM frameworks

## 6. Redis for Caching

### Decision
Use Redis for caching and temporary data storage.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: In-memory data store with high throughput
- **Data Structures**: Rich set of data structures
- **Persistence**: Optional persistence for data durability
- **Scalability**: Easy to scale horizontally

### Alternatives Considered
- Memcached
- In-memory Python dictionaries
- PostgreSQL for caching

## 7. PostgreSQL for Persistent Storage

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL as the primary database for persistent storage.

### Rationale
- **Reliability**: ACID compliance and data integrity
- **Performance**: Excellent query performance and indexing
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON support for flexible data storage
- **Scalability**: Good scaling options and replication support

### Alternatives Considered
- MongoDB
- MySQL
- SQLite

## 8. Prometheus/Grafana for Monitoring

### Decision
Use Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.

### Rationale
- **Industry Standard**: Widely used monitoring stack
- **Scalability**: Can handle high-volume metrics
- **Visualization**: Rich visualization options
- **Alerting**: Built-in alerting capabilities

### Alternatives Considered
- ELK Stack
- Custom monitoring solution
- Cloud provider monitoring

## 9. Docker Containerization

### Decision
Containerize the application using Docker.

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Ensures consistent environment across deployments
- **Isolation**: Components are isolated and can be scaled independently
- **Portability**: Easy to deploy across different environments
- **DevOps Integration**: Works well with CI/CD pipelines

### Alternatives Considered
- Virtual Machines
- Bare metal deployment
- Serverless architecture

## 10. Pydantic for Data Validation

### Decision
Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization.

### Rationale
- **Type Safety**: Runtime type checking
- **Performance**: Fast validation and serialization
- **Integration**: Works well with FastAPI
- **Schema Generation**: Automatic OpenAPI schema generation

### Alternatives Considered
- Marshmallow
- Custom validation
- JSON Schema
